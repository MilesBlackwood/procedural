Loops:
for loop - Takes 3 conditions, first one is the vaiable that will limit the loop, the second one is what the variable will stop at and the third one is whether the variable increases (variable++) or decreases (variable--) at the end of each loop.

while loop - Set the limit condition in the brackets e.g variable < 5 and you then chose the incriment within hte loop - This means you could incriment at different rates.

Array - A list that uses indexing to find values wihin that list
They can be created by calling the array type e.g int and then the variable name with a limit of spaces in the array e.g int array[5] 
We can also find values in an array by using pointers.
A pointer is a temporary variable that stores the memory address of the specified variable - if q is a variable *q is a temp variable that points to q's memory address.
If q is an array, *q will be the first element in the array and *(q+1) will be the seccond location in the array
