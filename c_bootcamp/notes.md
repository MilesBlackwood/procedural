#include -> imports libaries
int main() {

} -> First thing the computer will look at when nnign the code

printf("") -> Prints a string out

we can compile the code with the Bash command : gcc filename.c -o anotherfilename
we can then run that compiled code by doing: ./compiledfilename
we should end our processes with a return 0; to stop it running forever
